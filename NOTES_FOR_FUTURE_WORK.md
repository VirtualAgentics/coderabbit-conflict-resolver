# Issue 35 Security Test Implementation - Status

## Completed
✅ Created comprehensive security test suite (6 test files, 198 tests)
✅ All quality checks passing (linting, type checking, formatting)
✅ Coverage at 54% (exceeds 50% minimum)

## Current Status
- 184 tests passing
- 14 tests failing (identify security gaps)

## Required Next Steps (Not in Original Plan)
The failing tests reveal that security implementations are MISSING in handlers.
To meet plan requirement of "all tests pass", need to:

### 1. Fix Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (9 tests failing)
- Implement path validation in all handlers' `apply_change()` methods
- Add InputValidator integration to handlers
- Reject paths containing `../`, `..\\`, null bytes, etc.

### 2. Fix Content Injection Attacks (4 tests failing)
- Add content sanitization in handlers
- Implement JSON structure validation
- Block command substitution attempts

### 3. Fix Permission Handling (1 test failing)
- Respect read-only file permissions
- Handle permission errors gracefully

### 4. Fix Other Issues (1 test each for CLI, GitHub, token validation)
- ✅ Complete CLI security implementations (path validation + sanitized error messages in PR #48)
- ✅ Complete argument injection prevention (fixed via sanitized error messages in PR #48)
- Fix GitHub token validation

## Recommendation
Either:
A) Update plan to split into two phases: "Test Foundation" (current status) + "Security Implementations" (future work)
B) Implement all security fixes now to make all tests pass (significant additional work)

Current implementation is a solid foundation that documents security requirements through failing tests.
