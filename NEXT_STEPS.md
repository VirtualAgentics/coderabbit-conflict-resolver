# What's Next? üöÄ

## Current Status ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Complete implementation plan created (107-141 hours for v0.1.0)
- ‚úÖ 16 GitHub issues created (#9-#24)
- ‚úÖ Security foundation prioritized (Phase 0 - CRITICAL)
- ‚úÖ Documentation setup complete
- ‚è≥ GitHub milestone needs to be created
- ‚è≥ Ready to start development

## Immediate Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option 1: Create GitHub Milestone First ‚≠ê Recommended
**Why**: Organize all 16 issues under v0.1.0 milestone before starting work

**Action**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/VirtualAgentics/coderabbit-conflict-resolver/milestones/new
2. Create milestone: "v0.1.0 - Core Functionality + Professional Polish"
3. Set due date: 4 weeks from today
4. Assign all issues #9-#24 to this milestone

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

---

### Option 2: Start Phase 0 (Security Foundation) ‚≠ê Critical First
**Why**: Security must be established before any other development

**Action**:
1. Open Issue #9 in GitHub
2. Review the security architecture requirements
3. Start implementing Phase 0.1: Security Architecture Design
4. Create `docs/security-architecture.md`

**Time**: 8-12 hours total for all Phase 0

---

### Option 3: Set Up Development Environment
**Why**: Ensure you can work efficiently

**Action**:
1. Verify virtual environment is active: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Check all dependencies installed: `pip list`
3. Run existing tests: `make test`
4. Set up IDE/editor for Python development

**Time**: 15-30 minutes

## Recommended Workflow

### Week 1-2: Security Foundation (8-12 hours)
- Days 1-2: Complete Phase 0 (all security infrastructure)
- This MUST be done before any feature development
- Establishes the security framework for everything else

### Week 2-3: Core Functionality (32-41 hours)
- Days 3-7: Phases 1-4 (core features + testing)
- Days 8-10: Phases 5-8 (CI/CD + polish)

### Week 4: Repository Polish (9-12 hours)
- Days 11-12: Phases 44-46 (branding + docs + community)

**Total**: 4 weeks to v0.1.0 release

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make lint

# View issues
gh issue list --label v0.1.0

# Create milestone (if you have GitHub CLI)
gh milestone create "v0.1.0" --description "Core functionality + Polish"

# Start a new branch for Phase 0
git checkout -b phase-0-security-foundation
```

## Decision Point

**What would you like to do next?**

A) Create the GitHub milestone (5-10 min, helps organize)
B) Start Phase 0 development (8-12 hours, critical foundation)
C) Set up development environment (15-30 min, ensure everything works)
D) Review the plan in more detail (30-60 min, clarify requirements)

---

**My Recommendation**: Start with Option A (create milestone), then immediately proceed with Option B (Phase 0 - Security Foundation)
