# CodeQL Setup

## Status

‚úÖ **CodeQL custom workflow is active** with optimized configuration.

The CodeQL job in `.github/workflows/security.yml` runs on:
- Pull requests to `main` and `develop` branches
- Weekly schedule (Mondays at 2 AM UTC)

## Performance Optimization

**üöÄ CodeQL analysis is ~30% faster** thanks to removing unnecessary dependency installation.

**Key Insight:** For Python, CodeQL analyzes source code directly without needing runtime dependencies. The workflow has been optimized to:
- ‚ùå **Skip Python dependency installation** (saves ~21 seconds per run)
- ‚úÖ **Use custom configuration file** (`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`)
- ‚úÖ **Use security-extended query suite** (enhanced security coverage)
- ‚úÖ **Verify SARIF upload success** (better monitoring)

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Job Duration | 86 seconds | ~60-65 seconds | 24-30% |
| Dependency Install | 21 seconds | 0 seconds | Eliminated |
| Analysis Quality | Default queries | security-extended | Enhanced |

**Why dependencies aren't needed:**

For Python, CodeQL works by:
1. Extracting the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from source code
2. Building a semantic database of code structure
3. Running security queries against this database
4. **Does NOT need** imports to be resolvable or packages installed

This is different from compiled languages (C/C++, Java) which require a build step.

## Custom Configuration

The CodeQL analysis uses a custom configuration file at `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`:

### Query Suites
- **security-extended**: Enhanced security queries including additional patterns
  - Covers: CWE top 25, OWASP top 10, GitHub-specific security patterns
- **security-and-quality**: Combines security with code quality checks
  - Helps identify maintainability issues that could lead to security bugs

### Path Filters
- **Analyzed**: `src/pr_conflict_resolver/` (production code)
- **Excluded**: `tests/`, `docs/`, scripts, build artifacts
- **Benefit**: Focused analysis, reduced false positives, faster scanning

### Query Filters
- Excludes common Python CLI false positives
- Customized for project-specific patterns
- Can be extended with custom queries

## Workflow Configuration

The CodeQL job:
- **Language**: Python only (extensible to other languages)
- **CodeQL Version**: v4.31.0 (pinned with SHA for security)
- **Timeout**: 30 minutes (typical runtime: 1-2 minutes)
- **Permissions**: Minimal (actions:read, contents:read, security-events:write)
- **Upload**: SARIF results to GitHub Security tab
- **Summary**: Provides analysis details in workflow output

## Custom Workflow Benefits

- **Control**: Runs on specific events (PRs, schedule)
- **Integration**: Part of comprehensive security workflow
- **Customization**: Custom queries and configurations via config file
- **Consistency**: Aligned with other security checks (Bandit, Safety, pip-audit)
- **Performance**: Optimized for Python analysis (no unnecessary steps)
- **Visibility**: Workflow summaries show analysis status and optimization metrics

## Monitoring

### Check CodeQL Results

**Security Tab:**
```
Repository ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Code scanning alerts
```
View all detected security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

**Actions Tab:**
```
Repository ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Security workflow
```
Monitor workflow runs and analysis performance.

**Pull Request Checks:**
```
PR ‚Üí Checks ‚Üí Security / codeql (python)
```
View CodeQL status directly in pull requests.

### Workflow Summary

After each run, the workflow provides a detailed summary including:
- Analysis completion status
- Query suite used (security-extended)
- Configuration file path
- Link to code scanning alerts
- Optimization metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Default setup is enabled"

If CodeQL fails with this error:
1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Code security and analysis**
2. Find "CodeQL analysis" section
3. Ensure default setup is **Disabled**
4. Re-run the workflow

**Why this matters:** GitHub's default CodeQL setup conflicts with custom workflows. We use a custom workflow for better control and integration with our security pipeline.

### Error: "Configuration file not found"

If CodeQL fails to find the config file:
1. Verify `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` exists
2. Check file path in workflow is correct: `./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`
3. Ensure file is committed to the repository

### Warning: "Query suite not found"

If query suite warnings appear:
1. Verify `security-extended` is spelled correctly
2. Check CodeQL version supports the query suite (v4.31.0+)
3. Review CodeQL action documentation for available suites

### No Results Uploaded

If SARIF results don't appear in Security tab:
1. Check workflow permissions include `security-events: write`
2. Verify analysis step completed successfully (check logs)
3. Confirm repository has code scanning enabled in settings
4. Check for API errors in workflow logs

## Maintenance

### Updating CodeQL Version

To update CodeQL:
1. Check [github/codeql-action releases](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases)
2. Update SHA hash in `.github/workflows/security.yml`
3. Test with a pull request
4. Monitor for any breaking changes

### Adding Custom Queries

To add project-specific queries:
1. Create `.github/codeql/queries/` directory
2. Add `.ql` files with custom queries
3. Reference in `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   queries:
     - uses: security-extended
     - uses: ./.github/codeql/queries/
   ```

### Extending to Other Languages

To scan additional languages:
1. Add language to matrix in `security.yml`:
   ```yaml
   matrix:
     language: ["python", "javascript", "go"]
   ```
2. Update config file with language-specific settings
3. Adjust path filters as needed
