# ============================================================================
# Workflow: Security
# ============================================================================
# Purpose:
#   Runs comprehensive security analysis on the codebase to detect
#   vulnerabilities, security issues, and code quality problems.
#
# Security Tools:
#   - Bandit: Static analysis for common security issues in Python code
#   - pip-audit: Audits Python packages for security vulnerabilities (OSV database)
#   - CodeQL: GitHub's semantic code analysis engine for security and quality
#   - Trivy: Comprehensive vulnerability scanner for dependencies and filesystems
#   - TruffleHog: Secret scanner with git history analysis and verification
#   - OpenSSF Scorecard: Security best practices assessment tool
# Note: Dependency updates and security alerts handled by Renovate
#
# Triggers:
#   - Push to main or develop branches
#   - Pull requests targeting main or develop branches
#   - Daily schedule: Every day at 2:00 AM UTC
#
# Behavior:
#   - Fails the workflow if HIGH severity issues are found
#   - Generates detailed workflow summary with scan results
#   - Uploads security reports as artifacts only when issues are detected
# ============================================================================

  # Job: scorecard
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Runs OpenSSF Scorecard to assess repository security best practices.
  # Scorecard checks for security measures like:
  #   - Branch protection rules
  #   - Code review requirements
  #   - Signed commits
  #   - Dependency pinning
  #   - Security policy (SECURITY.md)
  #   - Vulnerability disclosure
  #   - CI/CD security (dangerous workflow patterns)
  #
  # Target: Score ≥9.0/10 (current target per Phase 0.7 requirements)
  # Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab for tracking over time.
