## Performance Issue

### Description

Describe the performance issue or improvement request.

### Current Performance

What is the current performance?

- **Execution time**: [e.g., 5 seconds]
- **Memory usage**: [e.g., 500MB]
- **CPU usage**: [e.g., 80%]
- **Throughput**: [e.g., 10 operations/second]

### Expected Performance

What performance do you expect or need?

- **Execution time**: [e.g., 1 second]
- **Memory usage**: [e.g., 100MB]
- **CPU usage**: [e.g., 20%]
- **Throughput**: [e.g., 100 operations/second]

### Environment

- **OS**: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 11, macOS 13.0]
- **Python Version**: [e.g., 3.12.0]
- **Package Version**: [e.g., 0.1.0]
- **Hardware**: [e.g., 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores]
- **Data Size**: [e.g., 1000 files, 50MB total]

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up test data: [describe]
2. Run the operation: [describe]
