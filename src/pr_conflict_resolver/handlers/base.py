        This method performs comprehensive security validation including path traversal
        protection, file existence verification, and collision handling for backup files.
        The backup file is created with secure permissions (0o600) to prevent unauthorized access.

        Security Features:
            - Path traversal protection using InputValidator
            - Absolute path containment checking
            - Secure file permissions (0o600) on backup files
            - Collision handling with timestamp-based naming
            - Automatic cleanup on failure

                InputValidator.validate_file_path() is invoked with allow_absolute=True and
                base_dir=self.workspace_root to ensure any absolute path is contained within
                the configured workspace root.

        Returns:

        Raises:
