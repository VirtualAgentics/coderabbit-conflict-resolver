# Running the CodeRabbit CLI

  CodeRabbit is already installed in the terminal. Run it as a way to review your code. Run the command: cr -h for details on comands available. In general, I want you to run coderabbit with the `--prompt-only` flag. To review uncommitted changes (this is what we'll use most of the time) run: `coderrabit --prompt-only -t uncommitted`.
  keep running coderabbit until it doesn't report anymore fixes.
