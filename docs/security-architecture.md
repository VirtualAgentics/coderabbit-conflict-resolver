# Security Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the security architecture for the CodeRabbit Conflict Resolver project. The system is designed with security-first principles to ensure safe, automated resolution of code review suggestions from AI tools like CodeRabbit.

### Purpose

This document provides:
- Foundation for secure development practices
- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Security principles and architectural patterns
- Implementation roadmap for security controls
- Compliance and audit guidelines

### Security-First Approach Rationale

The CodeRabbit Conflict Resolver executes privileged operations on behalf of developers:
- Reads from and writes to local file systems
- Modifies source code files
- Interacts with Git repositories
- Calls external APIs (GitHub)

These capabilities require a robust security posture to prevent:
- Accidental damage to codebases
- Unauthorized access to systems
- Injection of malicious code
- Exposure of sensitive data

### Key Stakeholders

- **Developers**: Primary users who trust the system to safely apply code suggestions
- **Security Team**: Ensures compliance with organizational security policies
- **DevOps**: Maintains CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure security
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to industry standards and regulations

---

## Security Principles

The following eight security principles form the foundation of our security architecture:

### 1. Zero-Trust Execution Model

**Principle**: Never trust input from external sources without validation.

**Implementation**:
- All GitHub API responses are validated
- Code suggestions are sanitized before parsing
- File paths are validated to prevent traversal
- No assumptions about file content structure

**Rationale**: External APIs and user input are untrusted by default. Every piece of data must be validated before use.

---

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

**Principle**: Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for operation.

**Implementation**:
- Read-only access to Git by default
- No network access except to authorized APIs
- No execution of arbitrary code from suggestions
- Restricted file system access scope

**Rationale**: Limiting privileges reduces the attack surface and impact of potential security incidents.

---

### 3. Defense in Depth

**Principle**: Multiple security layers provide redundancy when one layer fails.

**Implementation**:
- Input validation (layer 1)
- Path traversal prevention (layer 2)
- Secret scanning (layer 3)
- Atomic file operations (layer 4)
- Rollback mechanisms (layer 5)

**Rationale**: Multiple independent security controls ensure that a single vulnerability cannot compromise the entire system.

---

### 4. Secure Defaults

**Principle**: Default configuration is secure by design.

**Implementation**:
- Dry-run mode enabled by default
- Non-destructive operations as default
- Explicit opt-in for file modifications
- Secure logging (no secrets in logs)

**Rationale**: Users should not need security expertise to use the system safely.

---

### 5. Fail-Secure Behavior

**Principle**: System should fail safely without exposing sensitive data.

**Implementation**:
- Errors do not leak file contents
- Sensitive data is masked in logs
- Failed operations are logged securely
- No stack traces in production output

**Rationale**: Failures are inevitable; they must not introduce new security risks.

---

### 6. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Principle**: All inputs are validated and sanitized before use.

**Implementation**:
- File paths normalized and checked
- YAML/JSON/TOML parsed safely (no code execution)
- Line numbers validated against file bounds
- Content validated against expected structure

**Rationale**: Proper input validation prevents most injection attacks and data corruption.

---

### 7. Secure Communication Protocols

**Principle**: All external communications use secure, authenticated channels.

**Implementation**:
- HTTPS only for API calls
- Certificate pinning for GitHub API
- Token-based authentication
- No credentials in code or logs

**Rationale**: Secure channels protect data in transit and authenticate communicating parties.

---

### 8. Cryptographic Verification Where Applicable

**Principle**: Use cryptographic verification when integrity is critical.

**Implementation**:
- GitHub API response signature verification
- File content checksums
- Secure hash verification for suggestions
- Git commit signing support

**Rationale**: Cryptographic verification ensures data integrity and authenticates sources.

## Attack Surface Analysis

### Entry Points

1. **GitHub API Integration** (`src/pr_conflict_resolver/integrations/github.py`)
   - Receives code suggestions from GitHub
   - Parses comment bodies
   - Extracts file paths and line ranges

2. **Local File System** (Handlers: JSON, YAML, TOML)
   - Reads current file contents
   - Writes modified content
   - Creates backup files

3. **Git Operations** (Future rollback system)
   - Executes git commands
   - Manages git stash
   - Performs checkpoints

4. **Third-Party Dependencies**
   - PyYAML (YAML parsing)
   - requests (HTTP client)
   - Click (CLI framework)
   - Rich (Console output)

5. **User Configuration**
   - CLI arguments
   - Environment variables
   - Configuration files
   - Command-line flags

### Data Flow

```
GitHub API → Comment Parsing → Change Extraction → Conflict Detection →
Resolution Strategy → File Modification → Git Commit → Rollback Checkpoint
```

Each stage introduces potential security risks that must be mitigated.
