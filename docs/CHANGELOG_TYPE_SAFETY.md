# Type Safety Infrastructure

## ChangeMetadata Type Addition

### Context
The `ChangeMetadata` TypedDict was added in commit 208541a as part of the security and code quality improvements.

### What Changed

**Before:**
```python
class Change:
    metadata: dict[str, Any]  # No type safety
```

**After:**
```python
class ChangeMetadata(TypedDict, total=False):
    """Metadata fields for Change objects."""
    url: str
    author: str
    source: str
    option_label: str

class Change:
    metadata: ChangeMetadata | dict[str, Any]  # Type-safe with backward compatibility
```

### Rationale

This addition is **independent infrastructure** for type safety improvements, not essential supporting infrastructure for the security improvements.

**Why separate:**
1. **Not required** for security features (symlink protection, merged content validation, secure logging)
2. **Enhances** code quality and developer experience
3. **Maintains backward compatibility** via `| dict[str, Any]` union type
4. **Allows gradual migration** from untyped dict to typed metadata

### Benefits

- **Type safety**: MyPy can now validate metadata field usage
- **Better IDE support**: Auto-completion and type checking for known fields
- **Documentation**: TypedDict serves as inline documentation for expected fields
- **Refactoring safety**: Type checker catches misuse of metadata fields

### Migration Path

The code supports both usage patterns:

1. **Typed (recommended):**
```python
from pr_conflict_resolver.core.models import ChangeMetadata

metadata: ChangeMetadata = {"url": "...", "author": "..."}
```

2. **Arbitrary dict (backward compatible):**
```python
metadata = {"url": "...", "author": "...", "custom_field": "value"}
```

### Relationship to Security Work

This enhancement was added alongside security improvements but is **not a prerequisite** for them. The security features work with either metadata type.

**Security improvements that are independent:**
- Symlink protection in TOML handler
- Merged content validation
- Secure hash-based logging
- Input validation enhancements

These security improvements work with `metadata: dict[str, Any]` or `metadata: ChangeMetadata | dict[str, Any]`.
