# TruffleHog Ignore File
# =======================
# Excludes paths from secret scanning to prevent false positives from test fixtures.
# TruffleHog automatically loads this file when scanning.
#
# Purpose: Security test files contain intentional dummy/fake secrets (API keys, tokens,
# connection strings) used to validate the SecretScanner and security detection functionality.
# These test fixtures should be excluded from TruffleHog scanning to prevent false positives
# while maintaining full secret detection coverage for production code.

# Test directories containing dummy/fake secrets for validation
tests/
test/

# Common locations for test fixtures and examples
examples/
fixtures/
mocks/

# Documentation that may contain example credentials
docs/examples/
*.example.*

# Build artifacts and dependencies (scanned separately by Trivy)

# CI/CD and tooling configuration (may contain example values)
