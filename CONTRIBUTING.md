# Contributing to CodeRabbit Conflict Resolver

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CodeRabbit Conflict Resolver! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12.x** (required)
- **Git** for version control
- **Make** (optional, for convenience commands)

#### Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coderabbit-conflict-resolver.git
   cd coderabbit-conflict-resolver
   ```

3. **Run the automated setup script**:

   ```bash
   ./setup-dev.sh
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

#### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Install Python 3.12.x**:

   ```bash
   # Using pyenv (recommended)
   pyenv install 3.12.8
   pyenv local 3.12.8

   # Or download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   pre-commit install
   ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
   ```

4. **Verify setup**:

   ```bash
   make check-all  # Run all checks
   # or
   pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
   mypy src/
   black --check src/ tests/
   ruff check src/ tests/
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Run all checks**:

   ```bash
   make check-all  # Runs lint, test, and security checks
   # or individually:
   make lint        # Run all linters
   make test        # Run tests with coverage
   make security    # Run security checks
   ```

4. **Auto-format code** (if needed):

   ```bash
   make format      # Auto-format with Black and Ruff
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new conflict resolution strategy"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   **Note**: The pre-push hook will automatically run quality checks before pushing. If checks fail, you'll need to fix the issues or use `git push --no-verify` (not recommended).

### Available Commands

Use `make help` to see all available commands:

- `make setup` - Complete development setup
- `make test` - Run tests with coverage
- `make lint` - Run all linters (Black, Ruff, MyPy)
- `make format` - Auto-format code
- `make security` - Run security checks (Bandit, Safety)
- `make docs` - Build documentation
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make check-all` - Run all checks (lint + test + security)
- `make install-hooks` - Install git hooks for quality checks

## Pre-Push Hook

This project uses a pre-push git hook to enforce quality checks before pushing to remote repositories. The hook runs automatically and ensures code quality standards are maintained.

### What Checks Are Run

The pre-push hook runs these quality checks in order:

1. **Black formatting** - Ensures code is properly formatted
2. **Ruff linting** - Checks for code style and quality issues
3. **MyPy type checking** - Validates type annotations
4. **Bandit security** - Scans for security vulnerabilities
5. **Test suite** - Runs tests with coverage requirements

### Installation

The hook is automatically installed when you run:

```bash
make install-dev
# or manually:
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

### Usage

The hook runs automatically when you push:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-branch
```

If any checks fail, you'll see a summary of what failed and how to fix it. You can then:

1. **Fix the issues** and push again
2. **Use `git push --no-verify`** to bypass checks (emergency only)

### Manual Hook Installation

If you need to install the hook manually:

```bash
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

### Running Checks Locally

You can run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
make check-all  # Run all quality checks
# or individually:
make lint       # Formatting and linting
make test       # Tests with coverage
make security   # Security checks
```

## Security Scanning with Safety

This project uses [Safety](https://safetycli.com/) for vulnerability scanning. To run scans locally:

```bash
# Authenticate (one-time setup)
source .venv/bin/activate
safety auth login

# Run vulnerability scan
safety scan
```

The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs Safety scans using the [official GitHub Action](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-action). See [`.github/SAFETY_SETUP.md`](.github/SAFETY_SETUP.md) for details.

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- **Formatting**: Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) with line length 100
- **Linting**: Use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for fast linting
- **Type hints**: Use [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
- **Imports**: Sort imports with `ruff` (handled automatically)

### Code Organization

- **Modules**: Keep related functionality together
- **Classes**: Use clear, descriptive names
- **Functions**: Keep functions small and focused
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Testing

- **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage
- **Fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures for test data

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Include type hints for all function parameters and returns
- **Examples**: Include usage examples in docstrings
- **README**: Keep README.md updated with new features
