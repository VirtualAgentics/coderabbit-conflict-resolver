## Recommended Session Order

**Session 1: Documentation & CI/CD** (Phases 1-2)

- Complete all documentation
- Fix CI/CD issues
- Enable security scanning

**Session 2: Examples & Testing** (Phase 3)

- Create all examples
- Add test fixtures
- Improve test coverage

**Session 3: Feature Enhancement** (Phase 4)

- Implement metrics tracking
- Add conflict caching
- Enhance handlers

**Session 4: Publication** (Phase 5)

- Prepare package for PyPI
- Test installation
- Publish to PyPI

**Session 5: Integration** (Phase 6)

- Update ContextForge Memory
- Test integration
- Complete migration

## Critical Issues to Address First

1. Missing security scanning in CI/CD (security risk)
2. Missing getting-started guide (user onboarding)
3. Missing test fixtures (testing quality)
4. PyPI publication preparation (distribution)
5. Configuration documentation (usability)

## Notes

- All work should be done in the coderabbit-conflict-resolver repository
- No changes needed in ContextForge Memory until Phase 6
- Focus on making the package production-ready
- Prioritize documentation and CI/CD for user adoption
- Feature enhancements can be done incrementally
